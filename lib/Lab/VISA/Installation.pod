Lab::VISA::Installation - Installation guide for Lab::VISA

=head1 Installation on Windows

=over

=item * Install a recent version of L<Strawberry
Perl|http://strawberryperl.com/> (5.26 or later).

=item * Install NI-VISA and the drivers required for your instruments. E.g. for GPIB you need the NI IEEE-488.2 driver.

=item * Build and install with

 cpanm Lab::VISA

=item * Have fun!

=head1 Installation on Linux

As a Linux user you will probably be able to figure out things yourself.
Here is a rough outline:

=over

=item

Before you start, you must have the VISA library by National Instrument 
installed. If you plan to use GPIB connections (which is very likely), 
you must also have the necessary drivers (NI-488.2) for your GPIB 
adapter card installed. Refer to National Instruments' very good documentation for additional information:

L<http://digital.ni.com/softlib.nsf/webcategories/85256410006C055586256BBB002C0E91?opendocument&node=132060_US>

=item

In file C<Makefile.PL> adapt the LIBS and INC settings according to your installation. This is what worked for me:

    'LIBS'         => ['-lvisa'],
    'INC'          => '-I/usr/local/vxipnp/linux/include/',

=item

Then do the usual

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

=back

=head1 Testing the installation

Here is a quick test program that you can run with perl -Mblib test.pl:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    
    use Lab::VISA;
    
    my ($status, $sesn) = Lab::VISA::viOpenDefaultRM();
    
    printf "status: %x (%s)\n", $status, (($status == $Lab::VISA::VI_SUCCESS) ? "success" : "no success");
    print "sesn: $sesn\n";
    
    my ($status, $findList, $retcnt, $instrDesc) = Lab::VISA::viFindRsrc($sesn, "ASRL1::INSTR"); 
    
    printf "status: %x (%s)\n", $status, (($status == $Lab::VISA::VI_SUCCESS) ? "success" : "no success");
    print "findList: $findList\n";
    print "retcnt: $retcnt\n";
    print "instrDesc: $instrDesc\n";
    
    __END__
